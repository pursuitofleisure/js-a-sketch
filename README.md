# JS-A-Sketch

A canvas line-drawing app inspired from Wes Bos's Beginner JavaScript course. Features include: 

* Directional buttons for non-keyboard input
* Canvas overflow - allowing the user to continue drawing once the edge of the canvas has been reached by continuing the line on the other side.
